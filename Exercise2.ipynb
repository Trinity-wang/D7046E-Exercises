    "In this exercise, you have the task to properly validate the classifier and improve the training procedure to get a more reliable (and justifiable) score.\n",

    "In this exercise you will need to:\n",
    "    1. Define perceptrons by hand that predict the digits of a 7-segment display.\n",
    "    2. Implement a way to validate the performance of an MNIST classifier.\n",
    "    3. Rewrite the training protocol (the code) to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "    4. Produce a graph of the training and validation performance of the model over the number of training epochs."

    "A 7-segment display [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display] can be used to display the different digits by turning the different segments (A,B,C,D,E,F) on or off. Your task is to design ten different perceptrons that recognizes the ten different digits (0,1,2,3, ... ,9) represented by a 7-segment display. The input to each perceptron will be a vector {A,B,C,D,E,F} where A is 1 if segment A is turned on and 0 otherwise (and the same for all the other segments).\n",
